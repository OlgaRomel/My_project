                <p>ABOUT US</p><br>
                <p>J-Splash was founded in 1999 and immediately stood out for lightening up and revolutionising the world of outerwear.
                    Down jackets are no longer considered a shapeless sack, unflattering for the female physique and merely useful 
                    for keeping warm, but have become a sophisticated garment with slim and tailored fits, suitable for
                     every occasion. Combining thirty years of technical know-how with the best quilting available on the 
                     market and the lightest fabrics beaten to prevent down loss, add pulled off the feat.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    The brand is now synonymous with elegance and personality.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Each season, J-Splash creates collections for men, women and children, 
                    adapting the original essence of the brand to seasonal trends, proposing an experimentation 
                    of styles and forms, from the classic to more elaborate and conceptual designs.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    All J-Splash products meet the criteria of essentiality, simplicity, elegance and creativity.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Today, J-Splash is present in around a thousand boutiques and department stores worldwide.
